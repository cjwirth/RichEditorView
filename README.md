Installation
------------

#### Cocoapods

If you have Cocoapods installed, you can use Cocoapods to include `RichEditorView` into your project.
Add the following to your `Podfile`:

```
pod "RichEditorView"
use_frameworks!
```

Note: the `use_frameworks!` is required for pods made in Swift.

#### Carthage

Add the following to your `Cartfile`:

```
github 'cjwirth/RichEditorView'
```

Using RichEditorView
--------------------

`RichEditorView` makes no assumptions about how you want to use it in your app. It is a plain `UIView` subclass, so you are free to use it wherever, however you want.

Most basic use:

```
editor = RichEditorView(frame: self.view.bounds)
editor.html = "<h1>My Awesome Editor</h1>Now I am editing in <em>style.</em>"
self.view.addSubview(editor)
```

### Editing Text

To change the styles of the currently selected text, you just call methods directly on the `RichEditorView`:
```Swift
editor.bold()
editor.italic()
editor.setTextColor(.red)
```

If you want to show the editing toolbar `RichEditorToolbar`, you will need to handle displaying it (`KeyboardManager.swift` in the sample project is a good start). But configuring it is as easy as telling it which options you want to enable, and telling it which `RichEditorView` to work on.

```Swift
let toolbar = RichEditorToolbar(frame: CGRect(x: 0, y: 0, width: 320, height: 44))
toolbar.options = RichEditorDefaultOption.all
toolbar.editor = editor // Previously instantiated RichEditorView
```

Some actions require user feedback (such as select an image, choose a color, etc). In this cases you can conform to the `RichEditorToolbarDelegate` and react to these actions, and maybe display some custom UI. For example, from the sample project, we just select a random color:

```Swift
private func randomColor() -> UIColor {
    let colors: [UIColor] = [
        .red, .orange, .yellow,
        .green, .blue, .purple
    ]

    let color = colors[Int(arc4random_uniform(UInt32(colors.count)))]
    return color
}

func richEditorToolbarChangeTextColor(toolbar: RichEditorToolbar) {
    let color = randomColor()
    toolbar.editor?.setTextColor(color)
}
```

#### Advanced Editing

If you need even more flexibility with your options, you can add completely custom actions, by either making an object that conforms the the `RichEditorOption` protocol, or configuring a `RichEditorOptionItem` object, and adding it to the toolbar's options:

```Swift
let clearAllItem = RichEditorOptionItem(image: UIImage(named: "clear"), title: "Clear") { toolbar in
    toolbar?.editor?.html = ""
    return
}
toolbar.options = [clearAllItem]
```
